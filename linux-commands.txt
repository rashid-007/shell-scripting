# nproc: tells the number of cpu
# set -x: always prints the output in the debug mode
# grep
# pipe
# Interview question:
why the pipe command did not work in this case?
date | echo "today's date is"
# the above command will omit the date part and it will only print
"today's date is"
this is beause the date commnd is the default shell command and
it will generate no output if merged with pipe. The date command will
redirect the output to the stdin and pipe will not receive the output
from stdin. It will only receive the output as an input if the command's
output does not go to stdin.

Awk command:
 ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F"" '{print $2}'(Here amazon refers to
 a process that is running inside the system. It can be replaced with
 any process name)
 here the awk command gives you the output associated with column number
 2 only from several rows. 
awk -F"" '{print $2}'
